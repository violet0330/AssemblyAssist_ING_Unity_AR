# AssemblyAssist_ING_Unity_AR
Current work on project - AR prototyping system for industrial assembly guidance 

** only the necessary code and instructions are included to facilitate version return and traceability**

This work presents a projected Augmented Reality (AR) prototyping system for industrial assembly guidance. <br> 
The system is based on the Vuforia AR engine and supports real-time audio feedback about assembly steps and human-machine gesture interactions. The system also includes a personalized guidance feature that allows the user to modify the instructions and the assembly and to adjust the guidance strategy in time according to the user's capabilities.
