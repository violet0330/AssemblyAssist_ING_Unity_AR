# AssemblyAssist_ING_Unity_AR
Current work on project - AR prototyping system for industrial assembly guidance 

**only the necessary code and instructions are included to facilitate version return and traceability** <br>
*workflow is shown in master branch [readme.md](https://github.com/violet0330/AssemblyAssist_ING_Unity_AR/tree/master#readme)*
This work presents a projected Augmented Reality (AR) prototyping system for industrial assembly guidance. <br> 
The system is based on the Vuforia AR engine and supports real-time audio feedback about assembly steps and human-machine gesture interactions. The system also includes a personalized guidance feature that allows the user to modify the instructions and the assembly and to adjust the guidance strategy in time according to the user's capabilities.

## Ongoing work
September Completed:<br>
 * Manual change of teaching difficulty during assembly <br>
 * use TCP Connection to complete the communication between Kinect, AR camera and the main program, which can communicate in real time <br>
